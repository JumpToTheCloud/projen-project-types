# Projen Project Types

Welcome to **Projen Project Types** - a collection of opinionated custom project templates for [projen.io](https://projen.io).

## Overview

This repository provides a curated set of project types that extend projen's capabilities with opinionated configurations and best practices. These project types are designed to accelerate development workflows while maintaining consistency and quality across projects.

## What is Projen?

[Projen](https://projen.io) is a powerful tool for defining and maintaining complex project configurations through code. Instead of manually managing configuration files, projen allows you to define your project structure, dependencies, build processes, and tooling configurations in a single TypeScript file.

## Why Opinionated Project Types?

While projen provides excellent base project types, real-world projects often require specific configurations, tooling setups, and workflow patterns. This repository bridges that gap by providing:

- **Pre-configured project templates** with best practices baked in
- **Consistent tooling** across different project types
- **Automated setup** for common development workflows
- **Extensible configurations** that can be customized for specific needs

## Features

- 🚀 **Ready-to-use project templates** for various use cases
- 📦 **Integrated tooling** with sensible defaults
- 🔧 **Customizable configurations** to fit your needs
- 📚 **Comprehensive documentation** and examples
- 🔄 **Continuous integration** templates included

## Getting Started

More detailed documentation and project types will be added as features are developed. Stay tuned for updates!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve these project types.
